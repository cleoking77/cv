    <h3>Izzy's Bagel Shop</h3> <br>
    <p class="izzy-text">
      During my time at Izzy's bagel shop I worked in mulitple roles, gaining a variety of usefull skills.
I worked as baker, a cashier, a sandwhich maker, a food prep and I even did some creative art for the store every so often.
I loved this job and worked for the company for many years creating meaningful relationships that will stay with me forever.
A few of the most useful skills I gained for ths opportunity were;
      <ul>
        <li>
          Time Managment was needed to make sure everything was baked to perfection.
        </li>
        <li>
          An Eye for detailed was important as I had to make sure all the baked good and sandwhichs looked scruptious.
        </li>
        <li>
          Good Coomuncation was vital as we worked as a team with many moving parts, so I had to make sure everyone was on the same page
          so the operation ran smoothy.

  <h3>Server For Grafton Connor Investment Group</h3> <br>
          <p class="serving-text">
            I worked in many different resturants owned by Grafton Connor and I have to say it was a pleassure.
            This company always allowed me to move around based on what worked best for my schedule and always welcomed me with open arms.
            It was not an easy job as it was fast paced and could be incredibly stresssful at times. However these difficulties were so beneficial
            to my personal growth. I was taught so much during my years with this company, such as;
            <ul> <br>
              <li>
                <span class="percvierence">Percevierence:</span> No matter how hard the job got or how stressed the employes became, we had to push through
                and work as team to help eachother out. The better you did at this the more rewarding the shift and the tips were at the end of the night.
              </li> <br>
              <li>
                <span class="communication">Customer Communication:</span> This skills is so important in a resturant setting. Working this job position allowed me to learn how to read people and their personality types.
                This gave me the ability to adapt to the service preferences that each different customer needed. Doing so resulted in a high percentage of customers
                consistanly leaving feeling satisfyied and happy. This was important as the business relied on repeat customers.

              </li> <br>
              <li>
                 <span class="Efficiently">Efficiency:</span>  I learnt that the only way to do my job was to work smart not hard. I achieved this by taking steps like creating route plans for myself to follow, allowing me to move around the
                  resturant in a fraction of the time. As Well as teaching myself to take orders from over 30 customers at a time abling me to serve large parties without
                   fault. This position gave me the realisation that working Efficiently makes everyones life easier.
